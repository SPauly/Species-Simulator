# Species-Simulator
A simulator for neural networks running on different machines sharing the same environment via client-server framework. 
Species-Simulator is a project to practice asynchronous system design with a focus on scalability and smart, easy to manage code architecture. 

The server application connects to clients by sharing entity positions 
### Features

## Skills 
New skills which will be implemented over the course of this project are:
- asynchronous algorithm design
- network connections and sharing data using boost::asio
- smart pointers
- multithreading
- data management using serializable structures
- easy to use protocols and libraries to abstract low level code from the actual functional code
